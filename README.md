> Open Source User Identity Managment and Authentication

<br/>

## Status

Keygate is currently in a very early stage of development. It is not ready for production use.

<br/>

## Goals

- **Not too much choice**
  Keygate should be easy to use and easy to understand. Not a lot of options, but the right ones.
- **Easy to deploy**
  Keygate should be easy to deploy. Single binary, no database, no configuration file needed.
- **Portable**
  Data should be portable. You should be able seamlessly move your user data from keygate to your own solution. No vendor lock-in. No data lock-in.
- **Minimal features**
  Focusing on the core features of user identity management and authentication.
- **Secure**
  Keygate should be secure by default. It should be easy to use and hard to misuse. Insecure login methods like SMS are not supported.
- **Flexibility**
  It should be easy to build your own solution on top of keygate. Keygate should be flexible enough to be used in a variety of use cases, but not too flexible to be misused. It is not the goal to build a general purpose authentication and authorization solution for all possible use cases.
